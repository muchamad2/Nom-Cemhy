  benar: "Si = Silicon\r\nCl = Chlorine\r\nBased on the IUPAC rule that the first
    non-metallic element (Si) is named according to its name namely Silicon while
    the second non-metallic element (Cl) is given the suffix -ide to Chloride followed
    by the mention of the index of a number of elements. Because Chlorine has 4 element,
    the prefix is given tetra- So the proper name is <nobr>Silicon tetrachloride</nobr>."
