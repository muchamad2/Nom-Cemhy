  benar: "Between cations that have different oxidation states in the solution cannot
    form compounds.\r\nFe = Iron\r\nO<sup>2-</sup> = oxygen\r\nFe<sup>2+</sup> and
    Fe<sup>3+</sup> can bind to O<sup>2-</sup>\r\nDue to the presence of 2+ and 3+
    charges, according to the IUPAC rules the name of the cation is given the Roman
    numerals (II) if the load is 2+ and (III) if the charge is 3+ while the anion
    is given the suffix -ide so this compound is FeO = Iron (II) Oxide and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
    = Iron (III) Oxide"
