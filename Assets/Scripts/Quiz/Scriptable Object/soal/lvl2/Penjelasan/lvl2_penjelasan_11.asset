    that the first non-metallic element (C) is named according to its name ie Carbon
    while the second non-metallic element (O) is given the suffix -ide to Oxide followed
    by the mention of the index of a number of elements. Because Oxygen has an index
    of 2, the prefix is given di- so CO<sub>2</sub> is the right formula for the name
    Carbon dioxide."
