    monoxide has the structural formula CO.\r\nC = Carbon\r\nO = Oxygen\r\nBased on
    IUPAC rules that the first non-metallic element (C) is named according to its
    name ie Carbon while the second non-metallic element (O) is given the suffix -ide
    to Oxide followed by the mention of the index of a number of elements. Because
    Oxygen does not have an index or only amounts to 1, the prefix is given a mono-
    so that CO is the right formula for the name <nobr>Carbon monoxide</nobr>."
