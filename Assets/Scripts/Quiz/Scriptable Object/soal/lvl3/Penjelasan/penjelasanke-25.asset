  benar: "HClO<sub>3</sub> = Chloric Acid\r\nPenambahan satu unsur O = HClO<sub>4</sub>
    \r\nH<sup>+</sup> = acid\r\nClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> = Hypochlorate\r\nin accordance
    with IUPAC rules that for polyatomic compounds the name cation for H<sup>+</sup>
    is given the name Acid. (without romances because it is not a transitional element)
    In English, the name anion ending with -ate is replaced by -ic and acid writing
    is at the end.. Thus, the name of this compound is Hypochloric Acid"
