  benar: "P = Phosphorus\r\nCl = Chlorine\r\nIndex 5 = penta\r\nased on IUPAC rules
    that the first non-metallic element (P) is named according to its name ie Phosphorus
    while the second non-metallic element (Cl) is given the suffix -ide to Chloride
    followed by the mention of the index of a number of elements. Because Chlorine
    has 5 elements, the prefix is given so that the right formula is PCl<sub>5</sub>
    and the proper name is Phosphorus pentachloride"
