  benar: "Di = 2\r\nnitrogen = N\r\ntri = 3\r\nOxide = O\r\nBased on the IUPAC rules
    that the first non-metallic element (N) is named after its name ie Nitrogen while
    the second non-metallic element (O) is given the suffix -ide to Oxide followed
    by the mention of the index of a number of elements. Because Nitrogen has 2 elements,
    the prefix is given di-, while Oxygen has 3 elements, so the prefix is given a
    tri-. So the right formula is N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>"
