  benar: "P = Phosphorus\r\nS = Oxygen\r\nBased on IUPAC rules that the first non-metallic
    element (P) is named according to its name ie Phosphorus while the second non-metallic
    element (O) is suffixed -ide to Oxide followed by the mention of the index of
    a number of elements. Because Phosphorus has an index of 2, the prefix is given
    a di- while Oxygen has an index of 5, so the prefix is given a penta-. So the
    proper name is Diphosphorus pentaoxide. (adding -us to phosphorus is a deal)"
