  benar: "a.   NaCl (table salt) = Sodium chloride\r\nAccording to IUPAC rules the
    suffix of the second element is given an id\r\nb.   H<sub>2</sub>O (water) = Dihydro

    (ozone) = Trioxygen\r\nIt is in accordance with IUPAC rules that the index is
    mentioned at the beginning of the compound name. So the name of ozone in IUPAC
    is trioksgen.\r\nd.   NH<sub>3</sub> (ammonia) = Nitrogen hydrogen\r\nAmmonia
    has been agreed to be the IUPAC name for NH3.\r\ne.   SiO<sub>2</sub> (silicon)
    = Silica trioxide\r\nAccording to IUPAC rules, the first non-metallic name is
    stated according to the name of the element and the second non-metallic element
    is given the prefix and -ida suffix, because the index is 2, the appropriate name
    is Silica dioxide."
