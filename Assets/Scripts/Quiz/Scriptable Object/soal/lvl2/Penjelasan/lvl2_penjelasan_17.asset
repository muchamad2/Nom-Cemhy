  benar: "C = Carbon\r\nS = Sulfur\r\nBased on IUPAC rules that the first non-metallic
    element (C) is named according to its name namely Carbon while the second non-metallic
    element (S) is suffixed -ide to Sulfide followed by the mention of the index of
    a number of elements. Because Sulfur has an index of 2, the prefix is given di-
    So the proper name is Carbon disulfide"
