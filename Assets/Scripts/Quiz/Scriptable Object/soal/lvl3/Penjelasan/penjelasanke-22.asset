    accordance with IUPAC rules that for polyatomic compounds the name of the cation
    for H<sup>+</sup> (from the element Hydrogen) is given the name Acid (without
    roman because it is not a transition element) the name of the chlorate (anion)
    has the formula ClO<sub>3</sub> <sup> - </sup> Thus, the formula for this compound
    is HClO <sub> 3 </sub>"
