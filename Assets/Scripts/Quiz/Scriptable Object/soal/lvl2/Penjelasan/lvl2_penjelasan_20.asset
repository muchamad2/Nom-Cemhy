  benar: "\r\r\n<sprite=8>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the picture above there are 1 carbon
    atom and 4 Cl atom. So the structural formula is CCl<sub>4</sub>\r\nC = Carbon\r\nCl
    = Chlorine\r\nBased on IUPAC rules that the first non-metallic element (C) is
    named according to its name namely Carbon while the second non-metallic element
    (Cl) is given the suffix -ide to Chloride followed by the mention of the index
    of a number of elements. Because Chlorine has 4 atoms, the prefix is given tetra-
    So the proper name is Carbon tetrachloride."
